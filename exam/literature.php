<b><i>Jadavpur Universuty:-</b></i>The Department of Comparative Literature (Comp. Lit.) was started in the year 1956 and enjoys the reputation of a distinguished department to offer a subject which is distinct not only in India, but also in Asia. For the last two decades, the department has widened its sphere of learning to all-important Indian languages for comparative studies. It also exerts special emphases on African, Latin American and Australian Literature that are otherwise neglected in the taught programmes of the major departments of the Indian Universities. 
<br><br>
The Department of Comp. Lit. is renowned for its originality nationwide and serves as an exemplary model for other Universities as well. It seeks to incorporate a wide range of subjects and issues under its purview, an approach which is highly conducive for a multi- lingual, pluri-religious country like India.

<b><i>Persidency University:-</b></i>The Department of English (of the erstwhile Presidency College) is perhaps one of the oldest centres where English literature has been taught from the early nineteenth century onwards.
<br><br>
In its recent University avatar, the department is still in its formative stage, interestingly poised between its past glorious tradition of teaching British literature and an exciting future where the discipline has broadened its scope to include literatures of the world. The interests of the new faculty members reflect this rich diversity and range over Victorian Studies, Digital Humanities, Postcolonial Studies, Dalit Studies, Critical Theory, Indian Literature, Philosophy and Theology, Classical and Biblical Studies, Film Studies, Musicology, Early Modern Studies, and Creative Writing. Class room teaching continues the tradition of close textual analysis, often supplemented by modern audio-visual aids and techniques. Apart from formal lectures, there are tutorial sessions and informal discussion groups where faculty and students interact at a more personal level. Assessment is done through continual evaluation, end-Semester examinations, terms papers and dissertations. The students of the department also partake of a vibrant cultural life on campus, participating in debates, quizzes, drama performances and the like.
